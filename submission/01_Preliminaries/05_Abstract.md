# ABSTRACT

In the digital age, children are increasingly exposed to unregulated internet content, leading to concerns about screen addiction, exposure to inappropriate material, and excessive screen time. **SafeGuard** is an AI-powered Child Safety Platform designed to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive, supervised, and gamified digital environment for children.

The system features real-time content filtering using AI, granular screen time controls, and safe, curated video playback. It employs a **Parent-Child architecture** where parents manage rules via a dedicated dashboard, and children access content through a secure, restricted interface. Key innovations include:
1.  **AI-driven Content Analysis:** Automatically flagging and filtering inappropriate video tags and keywords.
2.  **Gamification:** Rewarding positive digital habits with badges and XP to encourage healthy usage.
3.  **Real-time Monitoring:** Live synchronization of watch history and status between parent and child devices.

This project implements a robust full-stack solution using **React, Node.js, and Supabase**, demonstrating the effective application of modern web technologies in solving critical social problems. The analysis of testing results confirms the platform's efficacy in strictly enforcing parental controls while maintaining an engaging user experience for children.
