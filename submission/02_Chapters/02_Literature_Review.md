# CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Existing Solutions Analysis

### 2.1.1 Google Family Link
Google Family Link allows parents to view activity, manage apps, and set limits.
*   **Pros:** Deep OS integration (Android).
*   **Cons:** Lack of granular content filtering within apps; purely restrictive (no positive reinforcement).

### 2.1.2 Qustodio
Qustodio offers cross-platform monitoring and panic buttons.
*   **Pros:** Comprehensive monitoring.
*   **Cons:** Expensive subscription; UI is often cited as complex for non-tech parents.

### 2.1.3 YouTube Kids
A dedicated app for child-safe content.
*   **Pros:** Massive library of filtered content.
*   **Cons:** Algorithmic failures have led to "Elsagate" incidents; difficult to completely lock down.

## 2.2 Gap Analysis
Most current solutions focus on **Restriction** (stopping bad behavior) rather than **Reinforcement** (encouraging good behavior). SafeGuard identifies this gap and proposes a **Gamified Safety Model**, where adhering to limits and watching educational content is rewarded, effectively shifting the paradigm from "Policing" to "Parenting".

## 2.3 Proposed System Utility
SafeGuard combines the filtering capabilities of traditional blockers with the engagement strategies of modern apps. By interacting with the YouTube Data API and applying a secondary layer of custom filters, it ensures a safer experience than standard platforms.
