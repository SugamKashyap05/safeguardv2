# CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE

## 6.1 Conclusion
**SafeGuard** demonstrates that child safety on the internet does not have to be draconian. By blending control with gamification, we created a system that protects children while respecting their autonomy and encouraging self-regulation. The successful implementation of real-time synchronization ensures parents are always in control, providing peace of mind in a digital-first world.

## 6.2 Future Scope
1.  **Mobile Application:** Developing native iOS/Android apps to control system-level features (app blocking).
2.  **AI Content Analysis:** Integrating computer vision to scan video frames for inappropriate imagery in real-time, beyond metadata tags.
3.  **Community features:** Safe content sharing between parent groups.
4.  **Hardware Integration:** Router-level blocking for total home network safety.
