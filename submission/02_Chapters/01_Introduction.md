# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Introduction
The rapid proliferation of digital devices has made the internet an integral part of children's lives (Rideout et al., 2017). While it offers vast educational resources, it also exposes young minds to risks such as cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and screen addiction. Parental supervision is often difficult to maintain continuously. **SafeGuard** aims to bridge this gap by offering a technological solution that balances access with safety.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
Existing parental control solutions often suffer from:
1.  **Over-blocking:** Restricting too much usefulness, leading to child frustration.
2.  **Lack of Engagement:** Children perceive them as purely restrictive tools.
3.  **Static Filtering:** Inability to adapt to new content trends in real-time.
4.  **Complex Management:** Parents struggle with confusing interfaces.

There is a need for a system that is *smart* enough to filter content contextually and *engaging* enough to make children willing participants in their own digital wellbeing.

## 1.3 Objectives
The primary objectives of the SafeGuard project are:
1.  To develop a **secure video streaming environment** that filters content based on whitelist/blacklist rules.
2.  To implement **granular screen time controls**, including daily limits, bedtime modes, and pause functionality.
3.  To integrate **gamification mechanics** (XP, Badges) to positively reinforce healthy usage habits.
4.  To provide a **real-time parent dashboard** for monitoring and management without intrusive spying.

## 1.4 Scope of the Project
The project is limited to a web-based application focusing on video content (simulated via YouTube API). Mobile application features and deep-packet inspection are considered future scope. The primary users are Parents (Admins) and Children (End Users).
